## Hello there. I am Kalu Stephen Eke. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" height="28px" alt="hi">

I'm a Full-Stack Developer with approximately 2 years of experience, now diving into Artificial Intelligence. I've built cool stuff (fully or partly) for various clients, exploring everything from Cybersecurity to Cloud computing. Not trying to know it all – just enough to build intelligent, secure, and scalable apps. Oh, and I’m really into SEO too.
